# Bayesian-Sensor-Fusion-and-Dynamic-Target-Tracking
Machine Learning-Driven Bayesian Sensor Fusion and Dynamic Target Tracking for Next-Gen surveillance systems integrating probabilistic reasoning, reinforcement learning and deep fusion networks for real-time decision-making. The system integrates a Kalman Filter for linear state estimation and a Particle Filter for non-linear uncertainty modeling.

## Overview  

This repository demonstrates an **AI-powered Bayesian sensor fusion framework** for real-time object tracking and decision-making. It integrates **probabilistic reasoning**, **Kalman filtering** and **dynamic re-tasking algorithms** to simulate how heterogeneous sensors (radar, LiDAR, etc.) can be coordinated for responsive defense or UAV surveillance systems. The project is designed to illustrate how **machine learning**, **Bayesian inference** and **real-time optimization** can work together to enhance situational awareness and resource allocation in high-stakes environments.

**Project Highlights**

1. End-to-End Defense AI Pipeline: Implements Bayesian fusion, Kalman filtering, and deep reinforcement learning to model intelligent sensor coordination for missile defense and aerospace tracking.
2. Dynamic Sensor Re-tasking: Uses information theory and Q-learning to autonomously prioritize sensors based on information gain ‚Äî optimizing tracking efficiency.
3. Real-Time Simulation Ready: Features modular, reproducible Python notebook with visual analytics and a one-click end-to-end demo for immediate experimentation.
4. Research-to-Deployment Alignment: Designed to bridge the gap between applied research and deployable AI systems, adaptable to various sensing modalities (radar, LiDAR, IR).
5. Open Research Contribution: Includes well-documented PyTorch implementation, reproducibility tools (requirements.txt) and extensions for future reinforcement-learning-based control loops.
